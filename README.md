# SKK dictionary (UTF-8)

This repository redistributes **SKK dictionary files converted to UTF-8**.
The original dictionaries are maintained at
[skk-dev/dict](https://github.com/skk-dev/dict).

* Converted files live under the `utf8/` directory.
* Conversion is reproducible from the originals in the repo root using `nkf`.

For SKK dictionary files themselves, see original README
[README-orig.md](README-orig.md).
